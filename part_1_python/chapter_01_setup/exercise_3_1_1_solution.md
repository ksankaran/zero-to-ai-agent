# Exercise 3 1.1 Solution: Explore VS Code

This exercise is about exploration—there's no single "correct" answer. Here's what you should have discovered:

## 1. Changing the Theme

**How to do it:**
- Press `Ctrl+K` then `Ctrl+T` (Windows/Linux)
- Press `Cmd+K` then `Cmd+T` (Mac)

**What you should see:**
- A dropdown list of available themes
- Categories like "Dark Themes" and "Light Themes"
- Popular options include:
  - Dark+ (default dark)
  - Light+ (default light)
  - Monokai
  - Solarized Dark/Light

**Tip:** Try a few themes to find one that's easy on your eyes. Most developers prefer dark themes for less eye strain during long coding sessions.

## 2. Opening the Command Palette

**How to do it:**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
- Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)

**What you should see:**
- A search box at the top of VS Code
- A list of all available commands
- The `>` symbol indicating you're in command mode

**Why it matters:** The Command Palette is VS Code's "do anything" tool. Instead of hunting through menus, you can type what you want to do.

## 3. Python-Related Commands

**What to type:** `Python` in the Command Palette

**Commands you should have found:**

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| Python: Select Interpreter | Choose which Python version to use |
| Python: Create Terminal | Open a terminal with Python activated |
| Python: Run Python File in Terminal | Execute your current file |
| Python: Start REPL | Open an interactive Python session |
| Python: Configure Tests | Set up testing for your project |
| Python: Create Environment | Create a virtual environment |

**Most useful for beginners:**
- **Python: Select Interpreter** — Use this if VS Code isn't recognizing your Python installation
- **Python: Run Python File in Terminal** — Quick way to run your code

## What You Learned

By completing this exercise, you discovered that:

1. ✅ VS Code is highly customizable (themes)
2. ✅ The Command Palette gives quick access to everything
3. ✅ The Python extension adds many Python-specific features
4. ✅ You don't need to memorize menu locations—just search!

**Pro Tip:** Get comfortable with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P`). It's the fastest way to do almost anything in VS Code!
